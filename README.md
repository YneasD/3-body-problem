# Three-Body Problem Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to simulate the three-body problem in classical mechanics, which involves predicting the motion of three celestial bodies interacting with each other through gravitational forces. This simulation visualizes the complex dynamics that arise from the gravitational interactions between the bodies.

## Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Render the positions and trajectories of the three bodies in a 3D space.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Customize the initial positions, velocities, and masses of the bodies.
- **Dynamic Interactions**: Observe how the gravitational pull affects the motion of each body over time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this simulation, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pygame`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-link>
   cd <your-repo-name>
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copier le code
pip install numpy matplotlib pygame
Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, execute the following command:

bash
Copier le code
python main.py
Adjust the parameters in the code as needed to explore different scenarios of the three-body problem.

Code Structure
main.py: The entry point for the simulation.
raycasting.py: Contains the Camera class, and render every point on your screen
