# 3-Body Problem Simulation

## Overview

This project aims to simulate the three-body problem in classical mechanics, which involves predicting the motion of three celestial bodies interacting with each other through gravitational forces. This simulation visualizes the complex dynamics that arise from the gravitational interactions between the bodies.

## Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Render the positions and trajectories of the three bodies in a 3D space.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Customize the initial positions, velocities, and masses of the bodies.
- **Dynamic Interactions**: Observe how the gravitational pull affects the motion of each body over time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this simulation, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pygame`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   `git clone <your-github-repo-link>`
   
   `cd <your-repo-name>`
   
2. Install the required libraries:
   
   `pip install numpy matplotlib pygame`
   
3. Running the Simulation
   To run the simulation, execute the following command:
   
   `python main.py`
   
Adjust the parameters in the code as needed to explore different scenarios of the three-body problem.
